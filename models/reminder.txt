Reminders for fellow team member:
1.go to db.js and change the username (username ===whoami in terminal)
2.run "node createDb.js" to create all tables into the db
3.if you want to create user, first to sample.json under table folder and modify the sample_data_user object. 
4.Go to cr8.js and comment out other function, only run create_user fn.






Things to fixed:
1.Date.Now is not showing the current time in the backend 
2. Time need some fixing. 
3. more query functions for get and post request.
