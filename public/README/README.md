<h1>DigitalTasks Google Chrome Extention version 1.0</h1>
<h4>Coded by Tyler Campbell, Eric Yii and Rich Oswald</h4>
<h4>Released: January 25, 2018</h4>
<h4>To: Public/Chrome Extention Market</h4>
<h2>Static Webpage for Signup and Link to Extention</h2>

<p>This app was written as a full-stack project for DigitalCrafts 16-week Full-Stack Immersion Bootcamp. The idea was presented by Tyler Campbell. He shared how his fiance would like an browser extention that would allow her to access her Google Calendar, tasks and contacts without going to those specific sites. The project involves a static webpage to provide information on the extention and a opportunity to sign-up for an account that links your information. The app itself includes the files necessary to post, download, install and utilize the extention from the Google extentions page and a database to hold user account information.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Back-end</li>
    <p>Since this was a full-stack project made after having gone through only front-end in class up to this point, it was quite the hurdle to learn and apply enough back-end tools to allow full functionality.
    <li>Layout</li>
    <p> Laying out the dashboard for a 60inch screen first, made making it mobile responsive a difficult endevor. 
    <li>Security</li>
    <p>Since this application was going to be used in a real world situation with proprietary data, it was important to limit access to the functionality to the team manager and make sure data was cleared each day. We did not import any historical data to limit vulnerability and complexity of data management.</p>
</ul>  
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this project was quite extensive. But there are several things that we would like to add and/or improve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the complexity of the celebration animations.</li>
<li>Insert the ability to have ticket goals for each team member.</li>
<li>Correct the admin login text fields to clear after error is shown.</li>
<li>Add animation to the submit buttons on the "add user" and "remove user" windows on admin page to verify submission.</li>
<li>Clear the fields on "add user" and "remove user" after submission.
</ul>

<h3>We want to sincerely thank our instructor, 🏓Chris Aquino 🐱, for his kindness, availability, encouragement, knowledge and wisdom. Without him, this project would not be currently, or probably ever, published.</p>
