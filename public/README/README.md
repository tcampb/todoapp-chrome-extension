<h2>Static Webpage for Signup and Link to Extention</h2>

<p>This app was written as a full-stack project for DigitalCrafts 16-week Full-Stack Immersion Bootcamp. The idea was presented by Tyler Campbell. He shared how his fiance would like an browser extention that would allow her to access her Google Calendar, tasks and contacts without going to those specific sites. The project involves a static webpage to provide information on the extention and a opportunity to sign-up for an account that links your information. The app itself includes the files necessary to post, download, install and utilize the extention from the Google extentions page and a database to hold user account information.</p>

<h2>I-Frame</h2>
<p>The extention is set in an i-frame, so it behaves as a webpage. The forward and back browser buttons function for the extention when it is opened.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
    <li>SSL Certification</li>
    <p>Providing a secure website address was absolutely essential for trust and to place the app out to the public. Many hours were spent and countless revisions were needed to accomplish.</p>
    <li>Authentication (Encrypting and Securing User Passwords)</li>
    <p> Making sure user information was kept confidential was of utmost importance. Verifying that a user is a real person is the entrance step to connecting to personal information. 
    <li>Database Configuration</li>
    <p>.</p>
</ul>  
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for this project required a massive amount of work to research, learn and code each of the pieces and then integrate them together. But there are several things that we would like to add and/or improve.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.</li>
<li>2.</li>
<li>3.</li>
<li>4.</li>
<li>5.</li>
</ul>

<h3>We want to sincerely thank our instructor, 🏓Chris Aquino 🐱, for his kindness, availability, encouragement, knowledge and wisdom. Without him, this project would not be currently, or probably ever, published.</p>
